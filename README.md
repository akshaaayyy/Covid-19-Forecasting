#  Web Mining Project
###  By Akshay Kumar
> This project provides an insight on the Covid-19 cases in the state of Tamil Nadu,India up to 4th May 2020.


## Introduction
> The Novel Corona Virus also known as Covid-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered corona virus. Covid-19 has caused the ongoing pandemic that has shocked the world with its ability to easily spread from one human to another through physical contact or through droplets produced while sneezing or coughing. What makes the Covid-19 virus even more dangerous is that its incubation period can last up to 15 days. The challenge in combating the covid-19 is that is ability to easily spread from one human to another even if the disease carrier is asymptomatic. 

>Till date, there is no existing vaccine nor effective treatment for combating the covid-19 virus. And only the biggest remedy to control the spread the virus is to wear PPEs such as masks, maintain personal hygiene such as wash hands with soap for 20s and sanitizing hands using alcohol-based hand sanitizers with 70% alcohol and to practice social distancing.  

>This report gives us the insights on the novel corona virus that has affect the state of Tamil Nadu in India. The report also gives a predictive analysis of the positive tested covis-19 cases and the deaths occurred due to it. The reports also forecast the covid-19 cases based on the prediction model. The report also gives a predictive analysis on the number of tests conducted. The report also briefly contains informative graphs on the trend in covis-19 cases and also contains the district wise covid-19 cases.

## Dataset

#### Dataset Link : https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-india  
> The dataset used for this project was taken from Kaggle, where State level data comes from Ministry of Health & Family Welfare & the Individual level data comes from covid19india. The dataset is a time series dataset where individual cases are recoded with details such as the date & time, state, district, the number of positive cases, deceased and the number of patients cured from the disease, the amount tests conducted throughout India for covis-19.
